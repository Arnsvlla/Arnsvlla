            Pampanga is known as the culinary capital of the Philippines due to its mouthwatering traditional cuisine and vibrant culinary tradition. Some of the dishes from the Kapampangan region, such as sisig, bringhe or paella, and Burong Kapampangan, not only left their stamp on the local culinary scene but also helped the nation become known for its cuisine internationally. Whenever one thinks of going on a food rampage, Pampanga always tops the list. Spanish friars and sailors taught Kapampangans the fundamentals of Spanish cooking while the Philippines was ruled by Spain. The technique of sangkutsa (precooking) and food preservation, which Kapampangans are known for, demonstrates their attention to detail when it comes to food. The creativity, kindness, and adventurous nature of the Kapampangan are what give rise to Kapampangan cuisine. Instead of simply cooking what the Spaniards taught them, Kapampangan cooks create, reinvent, and sometimes even improve each meal. Aside from creating its own original recipes, Pampango cookery also manages to create its own take on the most recent cuisine trend using fresh products.  The process of cooking and preparing seems simple. It is also best done with a dash of love, just like with any cooking.

        <h1>HOW FERMENTATION HAPPENS AND OCCURS IN BURONG HIPON?</h1>
        <p class="intro-description">
            Fermentation is a process that occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria
            or yeast convert carbohydrates into alcohol or acids. In the case of burong
            shrimp, the fermentation process is initiated by the bacteria and yeast present
            in the rice wine or coconut water, which consume the sugars in the liquid and
            produce alcohol and lactic acid. The alcohol and lactic acid help to preserve
            the shrimp, giving it a distinct sour and slightly spicy flavor. The fermentation
            process also changes the texture of the shrimp, making it softer and more
            pliable. The length of the fermentation process will depend on the desired
            level of sourness and the desired texture of the shrimp, and can range from a
            few days to several weeks.
