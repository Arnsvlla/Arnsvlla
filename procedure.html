        <p class="procedure-title">Today, I will show you how to cook the dish "Fermented Rice with Shrimp.</p>
        <div class="steps-container">
            <p>1.) First, you need to prepare a bowl of white rice. Then, it would be best if you rinsed the rice before cooking. No matter how you cook your rice (or which variety you're making), it's essential to rinse those grains. Then, add 1/4 tablespoon of salt to the rice. Then you need to calculate the level of water. Doing so will result in cooking the rice correctly. Then cook the rice for minutes; after cooking the rice, transfer it to a plate.</p>
            <p>2.) Then the next thing. Prepare the shrimp, then remove the head, tail and also its beard.</p>
            <p>3.) Add salt to the shrimp to make it ferment fast. Put the rice in a container . Add the shrimp. Then, add the rice on top of the shrimp. Repeat it. Until the container is full and the ingredients run out.</p>
            <p>4.) After that, put a plastic cover on the mouth of the container and then cover the lid tightly. After that, put a rubber band so that there is no air leak on the cup. Ferment for 3 to 5 days or more in a cool and dry place</p>
            <p>5.) After 5 days (fermentation gives a pinkish color to the mixture).</p>
            <p>6.) After that, get a pan, and put cooking oil on the pan. Please wait until it boils.</p>
            <p>7.) Then put the finely chopped garlic and mix it. Wait until it turns into golden brown color. Then, put the buro mixture.</p>
            <p>8.) Add more salt for seasoning purposes. Then, add an atsuete oil. Mix it. Make sure to mix it fully.</p>
            <p>9.) After a couple of minutes, add some water. Then, and then mix it. Cook it for 30-40 minutes.</p>
